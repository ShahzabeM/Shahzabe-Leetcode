| Problem                       | Description                                                            |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Contains Duplicate           | Check if any number appears more than once using a HashSet.            |
| Valid Anagram                | Determine if two strings are anagrams by comparing character counts.   |
| Two Sum                      | Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target using a HashMap.   |
| Group Anagrams               | Group words that are anagrams using sorted string keys in a HashMap.   |
| Top K Frequent Elements      | Return the k most frequent elements using a HashMap + Max Heap.        |
| Encode and Decode Strings    | Encode a list of strings safely and decode it back using length-prefix.|
| Product of Array Except Self | Return product of all elements except self using prefix/suffix pass.   |
