/**
 * Problem: Copy List with Random Pointer
 * Difficulty: Medium
 * Topic: Linked List, HashMap
 * Description:
 *   Make a deep copy of a linked list where each node has a 'next' and 'random' pointer.
 *
 * Approach:
 *   - We use a two-pass method and a HashMap to track mapping from original â†’ copy.
 *
 * Step 1: Create all new nodes with correct values.
 *         Store them in a map: original node â†’ new node.
 *
 * Step 2: Assign .next and .random for each copied node using the map.
 *         copy.next = oldToNew.get(original.next)
 *         copy.random = oldToNew.get(original.random)
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Key Realization:
 *   `.random` is just like `.next` â€” it's a hardcoded pointer to another node in memory.
 *   It's not a value or index we calculate â€” it's a direct reference to a node.
 *   Our job is to translate `.random` from pointing to an original node
 *   â†’ to pointing to the corresponding **copied node** using the HashMap.
 *
 *   We don't store `.random` separately â€” we rebuild the structure
 *   by following `.random` pointers in the original list and using the map to find their matches.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N)
 * Space Complexity: O(N) â€“ due to the map

/**
 * ðŸ“˜ How This Code Works (Full Explanation):
 *
 * This solution performs a deep copy of a linked list where each node has both `.next` and `.random` pointers.
 * It works in two main passes using a HashMap. In the first pass, we iterate through the original list and create
 * a copy of each node, storing a mapping from the original node to its new counterpart in the `oldToNew` map.
 * At this point, the copied nodes exist but are not connected.
 *
 * In the second pass, we use the map to connect each copied nodeâ€™s `.next` and `.random` pointers
 * by translating the original connections into new ones. The key realization is that `.random`,
 * like `.next`, is a direct memory pointer â€” not a value or index â€” so our job is to redirect those pointers
 * using our map to point to the corresponding nodes in the new list.
 *
 * The end result is a fully independent deep copy of the original list with the exact same structure.
